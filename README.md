# pytorch-projection_sngan
Pytorch implementation for conditional image generation with spectral normalization and projection discrimiantor.

spectral normalization: https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1QRgziT-
projection discrimiantor: https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByS1VpgRZ

The core code is strictly migrated from https://github.com/pfnet-research/sngan_projection

This code is working. There is currently no time to improve the training code and do more experiments. And I will make it soon.
